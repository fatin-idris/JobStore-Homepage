## Creative Improvements & Design Decisions

I focused on a clean, modern design that improves upon the original layout. Key improvements include:

- **Toggle Switch:** Added a toggle switch to make it easy to switch between Jobseeker and Employer pages.  
- **Search Bar:** Consolidated the "What" and "Where" search inputs into a single, cohesive bar for a cleaner user experience.  
- **Subtle Animations:** Added smooth CSS transitions to buttons and cards to make the page more interactive and engaging.  
- **Job Card:** Redesigned the layout and inputs in the job cards, prioritizing the job title and a clear "Apply" button to help users focus on the most important information.
