## Creative Improvements & Design Decisions

I focused on a clean, modern design that improves upon the original layout. Key improvements include:

- **Sticky Navbar:** I implemented a sticky navigation bar that remains visible at the top of the page as the user scrolls. This ensures that the main navigation links, and the important jobseeker/employer toggle, are always accessible. This will also directly enhances usability by ensuring that core navigation and the user role toggle are always accessible, reducing the need for the user to scroll back up and improving overall site efficiency.
- **Toggle Switch:** I added a toggle switch to make it easy for users to switch between the job seeker and employer roles. This provides a clear and intuitive affordance for the user to change their site experience and navigate the site's main functions without leaving the homepage.  This will improve clarity and directness in the user flow.
- **Compelling Hero Section:** I changed the heading to "Your Dream Job Awaits" and added the subtitle "Discover thousands of jobs from leading companies and kickstart your career." This updated messaging is a key UX improvement. It provides a clear value proposition by immediately telling the user what they will gain from the site, and it creates an emotional connection by using user-centric language that speaks directly to their aspirations. This makes for a more inviting and engaging entry point than generic site descriptions.
- **Search Bar:**  I consolidated the "What" and "Where" search fields into a single, cohesive bar. This simplifies the user interface and creates a cleaner, more modern look in the hero section. 
- **Subtle Animations:** Added smooth CSS transitions to buttons and cards. These subtle animations provide visual feedback and improve the perceived responsiveness of the interface, making the page feel more interactive and engaging.
- **Job Card:** I redesigned the layout for the job cards to be more scannable. By prioritizing the job title and a prominent "Apply" button, I've improved the visual hierarchy, making it easier for users to quickly find and take action on the jobs they're interested in.
