## Creative Improvements & Design Decisions

I focused on a clean, modern design that improves upon the original layout. Key improvements include:

- **Sticky Navbar:** Implemented a sticky navigation bar that remains visible at the top of the page as the user scrolls. This ensures that the main navigation links and the important jobseeker/employer toggle are always accessible, improving usability and navigation efficiency.
- **Toggle Switch:** Added a toggle switch to make it easy for users to switch between the job seeker and employer roles. This provides a clear and intuitive affordance, improving clarity and directness in the user flow.
- **Compelling Hero Section:** Changed the heading to "Your Dream Job Awaits" and added a subtitle. This updated messaging is a key UX improvement. It provides a clear value proposition and builds an emotional connection by speaking directly to usersâ€™ aspirations.  
- **Search Bar:**  Consolidated the "What" and "Where" search fields into a single, cohesive bar for a cleaner, more modern look.
- **Subtle Animations:** Added smooth CSS transitions to buttons and cards. These subtle animations provide visual feedback and improve the perceived responsiveness of the interface, making the page feel more interactive and engaging.
- **Job Card:** Redesigned job cards to be more compact and scannable.
  Each card includes:
  - Clear job title hierarchy
  - Company logo (rounded, larger size)
  - Location + job type & job type icons (different for permanent, contract, temporary, internship)
  - Bookmark/save icon
  - Prominent "Apply" button
