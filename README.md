## Creative Improvements & Design Decisions

I focused on a clean, modern design that improves upon the original layout. Key improvements include:

- **Sticky Navbar:** I implemented a sticky navigation bar that remains visible at the top of the page as the user scrolls. This ensures that the main navigation links, and the important jobseeker/employer toggle, are always accessible, improving site usability.
- **Toggle Switch:** I added a toggle switch to make it easy for users to switch between the job seeker and employer roles. This provides a clear and intuitive way to navigate the site's main functions without leaving the homepage. 
- **Search Bar:**  I consolidated the "What" and "Where" search fields into a single, cohesive bar. This simplifies the user interface and creates a cleaner, more modern look in the hero section. 
- **Subtle Animations:** Added smooth CSS transitions to buttons and cards to make the page more interactive and engaging.
- **Job Card:** I redesigned the layout for the job cards to be more scannable. By prioritizing the job title and a prominent "Apply" button, I've made it easier for users to quickly find and take action on the jobs they're interested in.
